2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock ACLK is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/buffer_fclk_clk_0.FCLK_CLK_0_BUFG/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ACLK is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock rd_clk is defined downstream of clock clk0_bufgin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock wr_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks rd_clk and clk0_bufgin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rd_clk] -to [get_clocks clk0_bufgin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks rd_clk and wr_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rd_clk] -to [get_clocks wr_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks rd_clk and clk0_bufgin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rd_clk] -to [get_clocks clk0_bufgin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks rd_clk and wr_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rd_clk] -to [get_clocks wr_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock rd_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/display_0/inst/DCLK. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock wr_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/display_0/inst/ACLK. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/display_0/inst/syncgen/i__carry__0_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/display_0/inst/disp_buffer/fifo_48in24out_1024depth/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.gnsckt_wrst.gic_rst.rst_rd_reg2_inst/arststages_ff_reg[0]/PRE, design_1_i/display_0/inst/disp_buffer/fifo_48in24out_1024depth/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.gnsckt_wrst.gic_rst.rst_rd_reg2_inst/arststages_ff_reg[1]/PRE, design_1_i/display_0/inst/disp_buffer/fifo_48in24out_1024depth/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.gnsckt_wrst.rst_wr_reg2_inst/arststages_ff_reg[0]/PRE, design_1_i/display_0/inst/disp_buffer/fifo_48in24out_1024depth/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.gnsckt_wrst.rst_wr_reg2_inst/arststages_ff_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>
